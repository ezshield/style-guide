      <div class="group">
        <div class="intro">
          <h2>Preface</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <blockquote>&ldquo;Authentically EZShield&rdquo; &ndash; How we stay true to our brand and the partners and customers we serve.</blockquote>

          <p>We are here to serve as the voice of reason regarding identity crimes&ndash;the antithesis of perpetuating hype. Everything we produce should reflect a levelheaded approach to protecting against fraud and identity theft. Simultaneously, we must give consideration to tone and voice as they can substantially impact how readers digest and interpret content.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="vt-present" class="cb"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="group">
        <div class="intro">
          <h2>How We Present Ourselves</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We are fraud protection service experts and carry the torch of an industry leader. Thus, our expertise underlies everything we do, from the services we provide to the communications we produce &ndash; always reflecting our respect for the serious nature of our business and the information we help protect. Simultaneously, we seek to engage our audiences and, therefore, we recognize the importance of adapting our messaging to best reach our various audiences.</p>

          <p>When we represent EZShield as a corporate entity, we do so with the utmost professionalism. This includes the way we project ourselves through our mission, vision, core values, press releases and corporate promotional pieces, such as when we appear in an event booklet sponsorship ad.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="vt-audiences" class="cb"></div>

          <h2>How We Communicate to Audiences</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve established how we present EZShield as a corporation, meet our audiences and learn how we engage with them:</p>
          <div id="vt-partners" class="cb"></div>

          <h3>Partners (Existing &amp; Potential):</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Platforms: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-corp">EZShield.com</a></div>
          <p>Communicating with partners typically calls for a professional tone, an extension of how we represent ourselves in corporate messaging. As an identity protection services provider, we are expected to project our high-level professional reputation throughout our communications with:</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Financial Institutions</li>
              <li>Insurance</li>
              <li>Benefits Providers</li>
              <li>Telecommunications</li>
              <li>Vendors &ndash; The nature of a particular vendor&rsquo;s business may affect the type and level of business detail that needs to be used when communicating with them and may impact the language used. For example, an IT vendor would expect IT-related terminology and a more technical tone.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><em>Additional note</em>: The way we speak to a particular partner may need to vary based on how a potential partner expects to be addressed. This must be determined early on when the sales team begins to interact with them. Any variations to voice and tone should be conveyed in-house as soon as possible. For marketing, that includes creative briefs to ensure that messaging is adapted appropriately.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong> of how we speak to our partners:<br><br>
          Our comprehensive award-winning services enable you to extend a more substantial offering to your customers.
          </span></p>
          <div id="vt-customers" class="cb"></div>
          <hr>

          <h3>Customers:</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Platforms: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-email">Email</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-goezshield">GOEZShield.com</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-fic">Fighting Identity Crimes</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-social">Social Media</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-legal">Legal Content</a></div>
          <p>Also known as our end-users, customers respond best to a professional, yet conversational tone. We must convey our expertise to give customers confidence in the services being provided while also highlighting their benefits, including how we empower them with information and news to proactively secure their information. Customers value human connections and clarity. So we must communicate clearly and with a personal touch so they know that the message is coming from real people.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong> of how we speak to our customers:<br><br>
          We&rsquo;re here for you 24/7 to help reduce your stress and give you more time to enjoy life.
          </span></p>
          <div id="vt-public" class="cb"></div>
          <hr>

          <h3>Public (Fighting Identity Crimes &amp; Social Media):</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Platforms: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-corp">EZShield.com</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-fic">Fighting Identity Crimes</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-social">Social Media</a></div>
          <p>Consumers seeking information from EZShield by visiting FightingIdentityCrimes.com and/or any of our social media platforms are expressing a level of care about protecting themselves. They are taking the time to read about fraud, identity theft, breaches or scams to gain greater awareness and learn tips to secure their information. So they look to us an industry expert that can guide them. Our communications must give them the assurance that they have come to the right place to obtain such information. And, just as with our customers, our messaging should be clear and conversational to offer them a human connection: we are in this together.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong> of how we speak to the public:<br><br>
          Follow our posts to stay on top of fraud news and get the best tips for protecting your information.
          </span></p>

          <h3>Sales Teams:</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Platforms: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-corp">EZShield.com</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-legal">Legal Content</a></div>
          <p>Whether we are communicating with internal sales teams or those of our partners&rsquo;, we must tap into their desire to sell. That means using a more conversational tone that inspires them to want to promote our services. Sales is responsible for engaging with many different individuals and groups so they must adapt to the needs of those various audiences &ndash; and that starts with how we speak to Sales.</p>

          <p><span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong> of how we speak to Sales Teams:<br><br>
          Help partners leverage our awarding-winning suite of services. This robust offering addresses the full scope of identity crimes plaguing their customers.
          </span></p>

          <h4>Tone and voice as they relate to specific materials:</h4>

          <span><strong>Professional & Serious</strong></span>
          <p>We use accurate and precise language in our service descriptions, industry definitions, press releases, white papers, data sheets and breach alerts.</p>

          <span><strong>Conversational</strong></span>
          <p>Customer-facing emails (that aren&rsquo;t alerts), GoEZShield.com, FIC.com, social platforms, sales PowerPoints, app descriptions.</p>

          <span><strong>Five important components of determining tone in business writing:</strong></span>
          <ul>
            <li>Appropriate use of emphasis examples:
              <span class="example">
                <strong>Right</strong>: As with any payment transaction or information sharing, there is a risk of your data being compromised.<br>
                <strong>Wrong</strong>: Hackers will steal your credit card information if you use it at suspicious locations.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Use of consistent active voice examples:
              <span class="example">
                <strong>Right</strong>: The fraudsters <em>(subject- preforms the action)</em> hacked <em>(action)</em> the database <em>(object- receives the action)</em> to obtain personally identifiable information.<br>
                The database <em>(object)</em> was hacked <em>(action)</em> by a group of fraudsters <em>(subject)</em> who were trying to obtain personally identifiable information.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Use of non-discriminatory language examples:
              <span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: Spouse instead of wife; seniors instead of old people</span>
            </li>
            <li>Emphasis of benefits to the reader examples:
              <span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: Potentially impacted individuals can reduce their risk of identity theft, therefore saving them time and hassle, by taking proactive measures early on.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Appropriate level of difficulty examples:
              <span class="example"><strong>Right</strong>: A poorly written job listing could allude to a scam.<br>
                <strong>Wrong</strong>: An employment advert that has been mediocrely crafted could foreshadow a scam.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Platforms Impact Messaging</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The platforms in which our content is presented determines the tone and voice of the writing itself.
          <p>Below are the basic platforms that EZShield uses to provide content to its viewers.
          <div id="vt-email" class="cb"></div>

          <h3>Email Communications</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Audiences: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-customers">Customers</a></div>
          <p>Emails are used to correspond with EZShield users and subscribers, offering exclusive information and updates to consumers who have shown particular interest in its services. As a result, readers expect personal, yet professional content. Here are a few tips to follow when writing email communications:
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of this content should be friendly, inviting and easy to understand. Emails should focus on relaying accurate information quickly and efficiently to users that are interested in EZShield&rsquo;s news and services. Newsletters should be informative, while also expressing enthusiasm for upcoming events and achievements.</li>
            <li>Use language that will be easy for users to digest. Emails are used for their efficiency, and therefore should not use complicated jargon and acronyms.</li>
            <li>Feel free to let your personality come through, while remaining professional.</li>
            <li>Data breach and scam alert emails should emphasize peace of mind and protection while illustrating the serious nature of these threats. A more serious tone is applicable for such emails.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Activity Report Emails</h4>
          <h4>Breach Newsletter Emails</h4>
          <h4>Service Alert Emails</h4>
          <h4>Breach Alert Emails</h4>
          <h4>Event/Announcement Emails</h4>

          <h3>EZShield.com</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Audiences: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-partners">Partners</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-public">Public</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-sales">Sales Team</a></div>
          <p>EZShield.com is considered the public site for EZShield where partners or potential partners find information about the company itself and its services. Readers expect thorough, detailed information that is easy to follow, yet professional. Here are a few tips to follow when writing for EZShield.com:
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of this content should be informative and confident in presenting EZShield&rsquo;s products and services. While it is important to use formal, professional language, it is also important to be approachable, not intimidating. The content should also emphasize prevention and reassurance to readers that EZShield understands their concerns, and that it is always working toward finding solutions for those questions.
              <span class="example"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: &ldquo;We are here for you.&rdquo;</span>
            </li>
            <li>Utilize visual data to enhance user friendliness and interactivity. Not only does EZShield want readers to understand the content it has provided for them, but it also wants readers to engage with the site as a whole. The easier it is to access the content, the more traffic that content will have.</li>
            <li>A consistent tone and voice is imperative. For this particular platform, the voice should be professional, yet engaging. Readers should not be confused about terminology or concepts presented.</li>
          </ul>
          <div id="vt-goezshield" class="cb"></div>

          <h3>GOEZShield.com (and other customer-facing service sites)</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Audiences: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-customers">Customers</a></div>
          <p>This site and similar such sites (customer gateway sites aka CGW) are designed for our partners&rsquo; customers, who are also our end-users. These customers are enrolled in our services via our partners (their financial institution, insurance company, benefits provider or other service provider). Thus, GoEZShield.com and other CGW sites serve as a platform to direct customers to the particular services they are receiving &ndash; and ultimately connect them to their dashboard if they have online services.</p>

          <p>Our messaging on these sites should be informative, but concise and guide customers in a straightforward manner. Here are a few tips to follow when writing this site content:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of this content should be friendly, inviting and easy to understand. The messaging should relay accurate information quickly and efficiently and offer intuitive interface.</li>
            <li>Guidance and instruction should be straight to the point. Break information into bullets if there is more detail needed. This will allow for clearer understanding.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Fighting Identity Crimes</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Audiences: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-customers">Customers</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-public">Public</a></div>
          <p>Fighting Identity Crimes is a blog that aims to act as clarity in the cloudy space of identity protection. Readers of this blog range from experienced EZShield users to passing-by consumers. The goal of this website is to heighten awareness about identity crimes, and to educate consumers about identity protection. Due to the vast range of readers, the tone and voice on this particular platform is especially important. Readers expect easily accessible information that is also easy to understand and share. Here are some tips to follow when writing for Fighting Identity Crimes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of this content should be casual, yet knowledgeable. Consumers visit this page seeking information that they can apply to their personal lives. The tone should allow inexperienced consumers to feel comfortable, while also reassuring credibility to more experienced users.</li>
            <li>Consistent tone is imperative. The voice used for this content should be professional, straight to the point, yet personal and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>Integration of personality in these posts is welcomed, but writers should think witty, not corny.</li>
            <li>Since this particular platform focuses on education, every post should teach readers something. Provide external data such as links, photos or graphics to encourage user interactivity. Offer supplementary resources to help readers further understand the content they are being presented.</li>
            <li>Consider the named author when created posts so they reflect appropriately:
              <ul>
                <li>Since Laura is in Marketing, the writing style of her posts should be the most personable</li>
                <li>With John B. as legal counsel, associated posts should reflect a law view</li>
                <li>For Eugene&rsquo;s posts, which focus on cybersecurity and technology, the writing can include more technological terms with clear explanations</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Examples of these guidelines for the three authors</h4>
          <p>Discerning between Laura, John B. and Eugene&rsquo;s FIC posts using examples from existing content (Bolded language differentiates types of voice and tone used between the three authors.):</p>

          <p>
            <span class="example">Cybersecurity is a <strong>hot topic</strong> in the identity <strong>theft realm</strong>, and for good reason. Think of all of <strong>your information-saturated</strong> online accounts: email, online shopping, social media and more are <strong>filled to the brim</strong> with personal and sometimes even financial information. (Laura)</span>

            <span class="example">Brian Krebs, the security expert credited with uncovering the Target data breach, first reported the Trump incident after <strong>corresponding with a variety of sources within the financial sector</strong>. (John B.)</span>

            <span class="example"><strong>Many of the recent high profile POS data breaches were caused by Backoff malware</strong> or similar cybersecurity threats being placed on the systems. With small businesses <strong>being hit disproportionately hard by data breaches</strong> and the average U.S. data breach costing $5.4 million; it&rsquo;s a risk many small business owners can&rsquo;t afford to run. (Eugene)</span>
          </p>

          <p>To further illustrate how to create distinct voice and tone for the three writers, here are examples of the way each would address this sample message: It&rsquo;s becoming easier for criminals to steal personal information every day.</p>

          <p>
            <span class="example"><strong>Laura</strong>: Hackers are lurking around every corner, and you could be at risk by simply swiping your credit card. (more casual, use of possessive pronouns like &ldquo;your&rdquo;)</span>

            <span class="example"><strong>John B.</strong>: Hackers continue to improve their methods of stealing personally identifiable information. As a result, the Obama administration has recently proposed a bill known as the Personal Data Notification and Protection Act that would help companies better protect their customers&rsquo; information. This act would ... (explain how bill would affect ID theft)  (this addresses the issue with an emphasis on the legal angle)</span>

            <span class="example"><strong>Eugene</strong>: One common way for criminals to steal your personal information is through ATM skimmers. Skimmers are technology that criminals use to ... (explains ATM skimmers) (this addresses the issue with emphasis on the technology used to commit ID crimes)</span>
          </p>

          <h3>Social Media</h3>
          <div class="interlinks">Audiences: <a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-customers">Customers</a><a class="btn btn-small btn-green btn-outline" href="#vt-public">Public</a></div>
          <p>Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are equally important to encourage conversations between EZShield and consumers. EZShield uses Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. Social media is especially public (in comparison to emails, public sites and blogs), and therefore should cater to all audiences. Because of the excess of content available on social media, it is important to use tone and voice to create casual and informative, yet concise and engaging posts. Here are a few tips to follow when writing for social media:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of social media posts should illustrate enthusiasm for both the company and the content that is being presented. These particular platforms focus on efficiency in sharing information, and therefore should be concise and straight to the point.</li>
            <li>Social media is used to start personal conversations regarding a specific topic, so feel free to be casual. However, the content should be short and to the point since consumers view millions of social media posts daily. Be the reason they stop scrolling!</li>
            <li>Specifically for Facebook, posts should not exceed 2-3 sentences, and should always be in active voice. Twitter posts only allow 140 characters, so make them count! Utilize hashtags and provide links to encourage user interactivity.</li>

          <h4>Examples of how one subject (in this case, a medical insurance vendor breach) is addressed differently from one platform to another:</h4>

          <p>
            <span class="example"><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: A software company that works behind-the-scenes in various healthcare facilities nationwide was just breached &ndash; exposing 3.9M consumers&rsquo; Social Security numbers and medical records. Consumers should be on high alert for financial fraud and medical identity theft following the attack.</span>

            <span class="example"><strong>Facebook</strong>: While you&rsquo;ve probably never heard their name, Medical Informatics Engineering might have just leaked yours...</span>

            <span class="example"><strong>Twitter</strong>: &ldquo;The #DataBreach Domino Effect&rdquo; &ndash; how a relatively unknown company can leak 3.9M peoples&rsquo; Social Security numbers.</span>

          <p>A majority of EZShield&rsquo;s content revolves around protecting consumers and their personal information. Whether potential partners are visiting EZShield.com to learn more about EZShield&rsquo;s fraud protection services or everyday consumers are reading content on Fighting Identity Crimes for educational purposes, personal information security is a top priority for most, if not all, consumers. Therefore, readers expect content that is accurate, easy to understand, as well as external resources regarding the subject matter. Here are a few tips to follow when writing legal content:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tone of this content should be calm and clearly explained to avoid alarm. While it is important to be accessible to readers, it is also important to write in a serious tone. People want their security to be treated as seriously as they consider it to be.</li>
            <li>If the content is alerting the reader that their information could be at risk, provide easily accessible resources such as policies, external links or FAQ sections to help readers further understand where their information is going and what is being done with it.</li>
            <li>Legal concepts and situations can be complicated, and therefore it is important to avoid legal jargon and other intimidating language that can cause panic. The goal is to reassure the consumer that EZShield is knowledgeable in the subject of identity protection, and that it will assist the consumer every step of the way.</li>
